"Brentonscrawltype" is a true type font that is meant to look like
a a document made by ahomemade typewriter with too much ink 
being used by a chimpanzee on acid. It isn't too readable, but 
it may spice up some documents. One of my favorite letters in it is 
the letter "c."

"Brentonscrawltype" is free, except for one thing.
