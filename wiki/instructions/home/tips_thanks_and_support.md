# Tips, Thanks, and Support

## All support will be moving to a new platform which is not FVTT

~~At some point after FVTT's launch (sometime January 2020 or so they say) I'll start up a patreon to fund new features in a threshold fashion rather than the typical subscription as I **detest** subscriptions of any kind.~~

~~What is this "threshold" paetron? It basically means that I'll set the patreon on "per creation" and set a goal of say $500 for emote editor, then charge nothing and make no paid posts. Once the $500 goal is reached, I'll make a single paid post to make a single charge to fund that threshold.~~

~~What this 'emulates' is a rolling kickstarter of sorts to fund new features for theatre. Thus it's funding that goes directly to a feature goal rather than a vague 'subscription' concept. It's also better this way since It will take months to create each major feature, so why use a 'subscription' if there can be months long gaps between 'creations'?~~

~~Until the paetron is posted, I put together a mini wish-list of sorts on Amazon that has all sorts of yummy beer I like. I'm also a large BabyMetal fan, so if you can throw me one of their limited edition copys my way, I'd be very grateful!~~

## ~~What happens if the paetron fails to gain any support when it opens in Janurary 2020?~~

~~That's simple. **Theatre's development will stop, and no future features will be developed.** I put this in _no uncertain terms_. If the community is unwilling to support more development outside of 'exposure' bucks, then I'll pursue other projects rather than continue to financially fund all the artwork and other costs, including time and effort, needed to advance theatre into a premier VTT tool.~~
