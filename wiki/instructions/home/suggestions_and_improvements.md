# Suggestions and Improvements

## All items are now staged for another VTT which is not FVTT. No future additions are planned for FVTT

~~Theatre has come a long way from its early concept, and there's always room for improvement. However since it has been such a time sink. I won't be immediately adding features to it for awhile, but feel free to submit issues as suggestions to add to the backlog to be tracked.~~

~~After FVTT's official release, I'll take stake on Theatre's use, and query for support for more features. If there's demand, and people are willing to _back it up_, I'll launch a small paetron to fund theatre specific features.~~

~~Here are a few improvements I've already earmarked for post-release should there be sufficient support for them to purchase the needed artwork + beer money.~~

## Future Wishlist Items

### ~~Emote Editor~~

~~This new feature would add an additional 'edit' button for every emote to allow for fine tuning of specific text modes or colors specific to that emote. In addition, it'll have a mini 'studio' to add custom animations with custom assets, and position them either absolutely, or relatively on the backing emote image. It would provide sliders to adjust such animations, as well as a "stick shift" mode to manually specify an animation syntax.~~


### ~~Cinematic Mode~~

~~This would add a 'Cinematic' mode button for the GM to allow for background effects within the theatre canvas such as cherry blossoms that flow both in-front and behind the theatre inserts active. This however is a very simple use of the cinema mode. It would allow for theatre-wide animations such as 'eye-line' cut-ins akin to persona 5, shaking the stage, adding 16:9 movie style bars, or focusing in a specific insert for a solo session / monologue. It would add scene transitions as seen in Visual Novels. This involves loading background images directly into theatre to be rendered behind the inserts, then applying a mask transform to switch it to another scene for smooth Visual Novel transitions.~~

### ~~Manga Speech Bubbles~~ 

~~This would add a 3rd option after text box and light box style for how to display the theatre text bar. In manga mode, speech bubbles rather than the bar will be displayed. Bubble borders and animations can be selected independently from text animation modes or emotes, thus you could have a 'spikey' animated speech bubble, and a surprised emote with bubbly text + a spin fly-in setting. Additionally changes can be made to the 'last speaking' logic to chain speech bubbles together for sequential messages just like in manga and comic books.~~
