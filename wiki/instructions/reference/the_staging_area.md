# The Staging Area

The _Staging Area_ is where various stage items will end up after they're staged from the actor sheets (or alt+right-clicked).

It's called as such, as it's an area, or bar where actors you want to trigger will gather; a "staging area" as per the name. It will show which inserts are active in the theatre dock, as well as those that not via a red border. If an insert is both active, and set as the current "speaking insert" then a flashing border will be present.
See the [control reference](/wiki/instructions/reference/control_reference.md) for additional controls in this area.
