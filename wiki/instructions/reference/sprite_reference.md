# Sprite Reference

There are no limits to the size or dimensions of theatre insert portraits. But the 'stock' animations do have a preference for where they want to appear and animate.

Note that for the stock animations for emotes, they place themselves as a ratio of the image rather than an exact pixel coordinate. For example, the emote bubble places its center point at 85% of the width, and 25% of the height of the backing image.

_Generally speaking_, if the face can be aligned at 50% width and 25% height, then most of the animations will look 'good enough'.

The ability to customize emote placement to the exact pixel or custom percent(%) is currently unavailable, but is [staged for the future](/wiki/instructions/home/suggestions_and_improvements.md) if the support for theatre in the community is big enough.
