[![Translation status](https://weblate.foundryvtt-hub.com/widgets/theatre/-/287x66-black.png)](https://weblate.foundryvtt-hub.com/engage/theatre/)

Theatre is a mod for Foundry VTT that allows for a visual novel style RP experience for text, and text-voice hybrid games. The primary function of Theatre is to allow for graphical 'theatre-inserts' or 'standin-graphics' to appear on screen with an accompanying area for text beneath them. This follows the style of visual novels, and even provides a means to animate or decorate the text as it appears in the below box. It also provides an emote system to allow users to configure different graphics for the various emotive expressions. Most of the emotes additionally have a built in 'emote animation' that occurs when the emote is selected, which can be toggled off globally if undesired.

# Installation For FVTT

It's always better and easier to install modules through in in app browser. Just search for "Theater"

To install this module manually:
1. Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2. Click "Install Module"
3. In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Oxy949/fvtt-module-theatre/master/src/module.json`
4. Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5. Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button

### libWrapper

This module uses the [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

### socketlib

This module uses the [socketlib](https://github.com/manuelVo/foundryvtt-socketlib) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.

### Key Binds
Theatre inserts now supports keybinds through the keybind API. The default keybinds are as follows (on windows):

- **Add OWNED Actors to Stage**: ALT+ Enter
- **Add SELECTED Tokens to Stage**: Shift + Enter
- **Toggle Narrator Mode**: Control + N
- **Flip Portrait**: ALT+R
- **Nudge Portrait**: Alt + Z/C/S/X
- **Activate Staged Actor Number 1/2/3...**: Control + 1/2/3...
- **Remove Staged Actor Number 1/2/3...**: Control + Alt + 1/2/3...


### Usage

Right-click an Actor in the list, and select "Add to stage." The Character will now appear in the small bar at the bottom of the Chat window.

Right-Clicking that actor tile will cause the actor's image and name to appear in the bottom-left of the screen. You can apply Emotes to them via the Emote Selector button, just above the chat box.

While the actor is selected in the small box, anything that is typed into Chat will be written as the Actor, and will also appear below the Actor insert on the left side.

Another button next to chat, the Megaphone, causes a black box to appear in the middle of the screen. Anything that the GM types to chat will appear in this box. This is good for describing a scene.

# Build

## Install all packages

```bash
npm install
```
## npm build scripts

### build

will build the code and copy all necessary assets into the dist folder and make a symlink to install the result into your foundry data; create a
`foundryconfig.json` file with your Foundry Data path.

```json
{
  "dataPath": "~/.local/share/FoundryVTT/"
}
```

`build` will build and set up a symlink between `dist` and your `dataPath`.

```bash
npm run build
```

### NOTE:

You don't need to build the `foundryconfig.json` file you can just copy the content of the `dist` folder on the module folder under `modules` of Foundry

### build:watch

`build:watch` will build and watch for changes, rebuilding automatically.

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

### clean

`clean` will remove all contents in the dist folder (but keeps the link from build:install).

```bash
npm run clean
```

### prettier-format

`prettier-format` launch the prettier plugin based on the configuration [here](./.prettierrc)

```bash
npm run prettier-format
```

### package

`package` generates a zip file containing the contents of the dist folder generated previously with the `build` command. Useful for those who want to manually load the module or want to create their own release

```bash
npm run package
```
